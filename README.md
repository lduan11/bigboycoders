# Corona Caretaker
This chatbot was made by Bryant Hou, George Zhuang, and Luke Duan for the Major League Hacking Summer League Event: Same Home Different Hacks. Please visit the project here: https://mlh-hackathon2-srtshu.web.app. We hope you enjoy!

# Inspiration & Product
Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, misinformation about the virus and its origin has become widespread on the internet. Corona Caretaker is a virtual assistant designed to help users stay informed and educated about COVID-19. By learning more about the virus through a conversational system, users will be enabled to stay healthier, help keep others healthy, and become more clearly informed.

# Overview
Users can type natural language into the input box to communicate with Corona Caretaker. Corona Caretaker will then process the user input and respond with relevant information about COVID-19 (including symptoms, transmission, common misconceptions/conspiracy theories, and best practices). Corona Caretaker will also respond to a variety of other natural language cues with witty, quirky, or otherwise nonsensical responses.

# Technologies
We built our frontend using React.js and create-react-app. We utilized Google Dialogflow for our natural language processing and response mechanism. To integrate Dialogflow with out frontend, we used Redux.js. Finally, we integrated the Google Maps API and Google Places API with Radar.io to set up for locating nearby testing facilities, however, we did not have time to implement these features yet.

# What's Next
In the future, we hope to create our own database of testing facilities in the US and then globally in order to implement a feature to help users locate nearby facilities through talking with Corona Caretaker. Additionally, we hope to add more intents to our Dialogflow agent so that Corona Caretaker will have an even wider array of responses and helpful tips. We hope that Corona Caretaker will help people learn more and stay safe.
